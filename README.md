## Setup

### Using the Default App (Quick Start)

The plugin comes with a pre-configured Microsoft Entra App by the original author [Lumos](https://github.com/LumosLovegood/obsidian-mstodo-sync). Just:

1. Enable the plugin
2. Run any command (e.g., "Insert summary from Microsoft To Do")
3. A device code will be copied to your clipboard
4. Follow the authentication link and enter the code
5. Done! You're connected.

### Using Your Own Microsoft Entra App (Recommended)

For better security and control, create your own app:

#### Step 1: Create App Registration

1. Go to [Microsoft Entra App Registrations](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade)
2. Click **Register new application**
3. Configure:
   - **Name**: `Obsidian Microsoft To Do Sync` (or any name)
   - **Supported account types**: "Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts"
   - **Redirect URI**: Leave empty for now
4. Click **Register**

#### Step 2: Enable Public Client Flows

1. In your new app, go to **Manage** → **Authentication**
2. Scroll down to **Advanced settings**
3. Set **Allow public client flows** to **Yes**
4. Click **Save**

#### Step 3: Add Platform

1. Still in **Authentication**, click **Add a platform**
2. Select **Mobile and desktop applications**
3. Check: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient`
4. Click **Configure**

#### Step 4: Add API Permissions

1. Go to **Manage** → **API permissions**
2. Click **Add a permission**
3. Select **Microsoft Graph** → **Delegated permissions**
4. Add these permissions:
   - `Tasks.ReadWrite`
   - `User.Read`
5. Click **Add permissions**

#### Step 5: Get Your Application ID

1. Go to **Overview**
2. Copy the **Application (client) ID**

#### Step 6: Configure the Plugin

1. In Obsidian, go to Settings → **Microsoft To Do Sync**
2. Ignore the first authentication try. This is the default Entra App.
3. Scroll to **Authentication**
4. Paste your **Client ID**
5. Restart Obsidian or reload the plugin

## Usage

### Commands (Ctrl+P)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Push to Microsoft To Do** | Push current task to MS To Do (no replacement) |
| **Push to Microsoft To Do and replace** | Push and update the line with block ID |
| **Insert summary from Microsoft To Do** | Opens list selector, inserts tasks with tracking IDs |
| **Open To Do** | Opens the task in Microsoft To Do app/web |

### Context Menu (Right-click on Microsoft To Do)

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Push to default list** | Push selected task to your default list |
| **Push to list...** | Choose which list to push the task to |
| **Insert tasks from list...** | Import tasks from a To Do list |
| **Sync all tasks** | Synchronize all tracked tasks in the vault |
| **Refresh selected task** | Update the selected task from To Do |
| **Open task in To Do app** | Open the task in Microsoft To Do |

### Task Format

Tasks are tracked using Obsidian block IDs:

```markdown
- [ ] My task title ^MSTDa8de00001
  - [ ] Subtask 1
  - [ ] Subtask 2
  Notes about the task...
```

The `^MSTDa8de00001` links this task to the corresponding Microsoft To Do task.

## Auto-Sync Behavior

The plugin automatically syncs in these situations:

1. **On Plugin Start** - Syncs 5 seconds after Obsidian loads
2. **On File Save** - When you (auto)save a file containing tracked tasks (`^MSTD...`)
   - Uses 3-second debounce to avoid excessive syncing
   - 10-second cooldown per file to prevent loops

## Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Default List Name** | The MS To Do list to sync with (default: "Obsidian Tasks") |
| **Date Format** | Format for dates (default: `YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| **Priority Indicators** | Emojis for high/normal/low priority |
| **Status Indicators** | Characters for task status (`x`, `/`, ` `) |
| **Client ID** | Your own Entra App Client ID (optional) |
| **Auto Sync Interval** | Interval in minutes for background sync (default: 10) |
| **Debug Logging** | Enable verbose logs for troubleshooting |

## Troubleshooting
### Tasks not syncing
- Ensure tasks have a block ID (`^MSTD...`)
- Check if the list name in settings matches your MS To Do list
- Try "Reset Task Cache" from the Hacking menu (if enabled)

### Authentication issues
- Revoke permissions at [Microsoft Account](https://account.live.com/consent/Manage)
- Re-authenticate with the plugin
